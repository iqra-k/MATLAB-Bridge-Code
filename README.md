# MATLAB-Bridge-Code

A small-scale  box girder bridge was build out of matboard that will be subjected to increasing loads until failure. To effectively comprehend and implement the engineering principle of iterative design , a MATLAB program was designed. This tool will be used to carry out a series of calculations, with the aim of predicting the failure load of a bridge. By repeatedly running the script, the design inputs (bridge geometry) that result in the highest failure load can be determined
